## Python - Inheritance
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the Python programming language:
> superclass, baseclass, and subclasses; utilizing parent classes' attributes and methods;
> overwriting parent classes' methods

### Description of what each file shows:
* tests ---------- folder holds tests and edge cases checking
* Files that start with:
1. function that returns list of attributes and methods of object
2. class that inherits from list and prints sorted list
3. function using type() - same object
4. function using isinstance() - same class inherited from
5. function using issubclass() - only subclass of
6. empty class BaseGeometry (so next questions can build on this one)
7. add area method that's empty
8. add integer_validator method
9. class Rectangle that inherits BaseGeometry; initializes private width, height
10. implement __str__ to print
11. class Square that inherits Rectangle; initialize size and use area
12. implement area and print
13.  100- class MyInt that inherits from int; inverts == and != operations
14.  101- set attribute to object if possible
