## Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the Python programming language:
> lists, tuples

### Description of what each file shows:
* main_test_files ----- folder holds test files that showcase examples of how to use functions
* lists.h ---------- holds files' function prototypes for #13
* Files that start with:
0. prints all integers of a list
1. function that retrieves an element from a list like on
2. function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C)
3. function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order
4. function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C)
5. function that removes all characters c and C from a string
6. function that prints a matrix of integers
7. function that adds 2 tuples
8. function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character
9. function that finds the biggest integer of a list
10. function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list
11. function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list
12. switch value of a and b
13. function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome
