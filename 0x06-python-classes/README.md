## Python - Classes and Objects
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the Python programming language:
> classes, instances, private/public fields/attributes, methods/functions, ```__str__``` to print,
> comparator methods (```!=``` ```__ne__```, ```==``` ```__eq__```, ```>=``` ```__ge__```, ```>``` ```__gt__```, ```<``` ```__lt__```, ```<=``` ```__lt__```)

### Description of what each file shows:
* main files holds code that showcase examples of how to use functions
* Files that start with:
1. create empty square class and build on this class in next files
2. add private attribute size
3. validate size is int and >= 0 else TypeError
4. define public method area with ValueError if size < 0
5. define getter and setter for size
6. define print method to print square with "#"'s
7. define private position attribute to use in printing offsets
8. 100-Singly Linked List - create head, insert nodes, print with ```__str__```
9. 101-define ```__str__``` method to print square if called with print()
10. 102-define comparator methods
11. recreate code to match Bytecode (re: class, import, private attribute)
